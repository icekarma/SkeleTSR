# SkeleTSR: A skeleton TSR for MS-DOS/PC DOS.

SkeleTSR is a minimalistic Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program designed
for the MS-DOS and PC DOS environment. It serves as a foundational template for
developers looking to create their own TSR applications.

## Features

- Minimalistic design for easy customization.
- Basic framework for TSR functionality.
- Written in assembly language for ease of access to low-level functionality.

## Getting Started

To use SkeleTSR as a base for your own TSR, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/icekarma/SkeleTSR.git
   ```

2. Modify the source code to implement your desired functionality.

3. Assemble the code using an assembler like TASM or MASM. It's been developed
   with TASM 4.1, but should work with other assemblers with only minor
   adjustments.

4. Test your TSR in a DOS environment.
